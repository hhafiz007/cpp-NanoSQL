In this challenge, I'll build a barebones SQLite implementation that supports
basic SQL queries like `SELECT`. Along the way we'll learn about
[SQLite's file format](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html), how indexed data
is
[stored in B-trees](https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/10/02/how-does-sqlite-work-part-2-btrees/)
and more.

 your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.

# Sample Databases

This contains two tables: `apples` & `oranges`.

You can explore this database by running queries against it like this:

```sh
$ sqlite3 sample.db "select id, name from apples"
1|Granny Smith
2|Fuji
3|Honeycrisp
4|Golden Delicious
```

There are two other databases that you can use:

1. `superheroes.db`:
   - This is a small version of the test database used in the table-scan stage.
   - It contains one table: `superheroes`.
   - It is ~1MB in size.
1. `companies.db`:
   - This is a small version of the test database used in the index-scan stage.
   - It contains one table: `companies`, and one index: `idx_companies_country`
   - It is ~7MB in size.

These aren't included in the repository because they're large in size. You can
download them by running this script:

```sh
./download_sample_databases.sh
```
